1. Jira Field Extraction
Goal: Get all fields from both source and destination Jira instances.
How: Use Jira REST API (/rest/api/2/field) with your credentials.
Code: Write Python functions to fetch and parse fields for both instances.

2. Field Mapping in Product
Goal: Map which fields the user wants to sync.
How: Store mappings in your product (DB, config file, or UI selection).
Code: Create a structure (e.g., dictionary or database table) to hold these mappings.

3. Compare Source and Destination Fields
Goal: Ensure mapped fields exist in both Jira instances.
How: Compare field keys/names from both APIs against your mapping.
Code: Write a comparison function that flags missing or mismatched fields.

4. Get Synced Fields List from Product
Goal: Retrieve the list of fields your product actually synced.
How: Query your product’s sync logs, database, or API.
Code: Write a function to extract this list.

5. Get Reporting Page Fields Synced List
Goal: Scrape or fetch the reporting page’s “fields synced” list.
How: Use Selenium to navigate and extract the list, or use an API if available.
Code: Write a Selenium function to get the displayed list.

6. Compare Synced Lists
Goal: Compare the product’s synced fields list with the reporting page’s list.
How: Find differences, missing, or extra fields.
Code: Write a comparison and reporting function.

7. Final Result & Reporting
Goal: Output a clear report of matches, mismatches, and missing fields.
How: Print/log results, or generate a downloadable report.
Code: Format results for easy review (console, file, or UI).
